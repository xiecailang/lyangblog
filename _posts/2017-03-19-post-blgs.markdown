> "what's the purpose of my life?"

I don't know how to organize my words, but just want to record my feelings in sometimes. Like this moment, as kept moving for a long time without any breaks. Forgive me, inexplicable in a bad mood, do not want to think anything, just one quiet daze. Lost in the music and stairing blankly. Storing energy for tomorrow, hope and dreams. After regulating my emotions, I will set off again at a more sedate pace with my love.
